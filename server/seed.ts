I didn't expect to meet you that day. The forecast said rain, but I went out anyway, drawn by the last day of cherry blossom season at Yeouido Park.

The petals were falling like snow, and I was trying to capture the perfect photo when my camera slipped from my hands. Before it could hit the ground, you caught it.

"Careful," you said, smiling. "These moments are too precious to drop."

That's when I first saw your eyes – warm, kind, and somehow familiar, as if I'd known them in another lifetime.

They say there's a red thread connecting those who are destined to meet. In that moment, under the falling petals, I felt it pull tight between us.`,

We walked together that afternoon, comparing photos, talking about nothing and everything. You told me about your work as a photographer, how you chase light and moments. I told you about my writing, how I try to capture feelings in words.

When the rain finally came, we stood under a single umbrella, watching the last petals wash away down the street.

"I feel like I've been waiting to meet you," you said quietly.

"Me too," I whispered back, and I meant it with every fiber of my being.

Love. That was the first time either of us had said it out loud.

"Yes," I agreed, feeling the red thread between us pull tighter, more visible, more real.

You took a photo of us in the café window, the spring light filtering through, our reflections overlapping with the Seoul street behind us.
